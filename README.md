# Logo Detection

This project employs the YOLOv8 architecture, a cutting-edge deep learning model tailored for precise object detection tasks. The model harnesses the power of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve efficient and accurate detection and localization of objects, specifically Pepsi and Coca-Cola logos, within images or video frames

## Dependicies

- Python3 
- pip
- YOLO v8
- OPENCV (cv2)


## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logo-detection.git
cd logo-detection
```

2 Install the dependicies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


## Running the Project

1 Prepare input video
2 run the script 
    python3 file_name.py

## Output

1 It will return a json file which returns timestamps of the pepsi and coca cola logos  , size and distance from the center.
2 It will return a video.mp4
